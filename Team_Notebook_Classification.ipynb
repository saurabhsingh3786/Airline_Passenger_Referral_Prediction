        "Customer referral is a crucial aspect of business growth and success, and the airline industry is no exception. Satisfied passengers who have had positive experiences with an airline are more likely to refer the airline to their friends, family, and colleagues. Identifying these potential advocates can help airlines improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and attract new customers.\n",

We will use a dataset that includes past passengers and their referral behavior, as well as various features such as age, gender, flight class, and route information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our first step will be to perform preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features and after that exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or correlations .\n",

        "We will then apply several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, and support vector machines, to predict the likelihood of a passenger becoming a referral. We will also perform feature engineering and selection to improve the performance of our models.\n",

        "Finally, we will evaluate our models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We will also use techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to tune our hyperparameters and ensure our models generalize well to new data.\n",

Include other factors: The factors included in this project are not the only factors that influence a passenger's decision to refer an airline. Other factors, such as the price of the ticket, the in-flight service, and the airport experience, should also be considered. Use more advanced machine learning techniques: The machine learning models used in this project are relatively simple. More advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, could be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions."

        "\n",
        "The problem at hand revolves around the airline's inability to predict which passengers are likely to refer their services to others. Despite the recognized significance of passenger referrals as a driver of customer acquisition and loyalty, the absence of a predictive mechanism hampers the airline's ability to strategically leverage this influential marketing channel. The challenge lies in developing an accurate predictive model that takes into account diverse passenger attributes and behaviors to foresee referral likelihood. This problem obstructs the airline's potential to maximize referrals as a means of enhancing business growth and customer engagement."
